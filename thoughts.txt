Goal: "Which courses need extra seats"
What data we need: Total students interested in the course (Enrolled + WL), WL size after the drop date, How many people enrolled in the end
What information we need: # of students who wanted to join but couldn't

What statistical/ML we need to use: Regression

Extra idea: Do a statistical test on burnaby & surrey (is there a difference between the mean of total ppl interested in the course or not)
Extra idea: Find out if there are less students enrolling in courses during covid


How many students intersted in the course:
- Group by semester & Class & Section, max(enrolled + WL)

WL Size after the drop date:
- Look at 2 week window (From class start till the 2 weeks drop deadline ) to decide when is sensible to extract the waitlist number

# of students who wanted to join but couldn't (combined for every section):
- Priorized data
- How to use this data: Group this per course/sem/campus, sort according to time and regress to predict how many students wants to join but couldn't in the future
    - This will tell us how many seats should we add

Note: We will need to write down external factors in enrollment (eg: Which professors are teaching, covid numbers and how they affect enrollment, time of course (eg. 8.30 vs 1.30 courses))
Note: Total students interested - How many enrolled in the end reflects: # of students who wanted to join the course but couldn't + # of students who dropped the course
Note: WL size after drop date reflects: # of students who wanted to join but couldn't - # of students who dropped the WL

Extra: How fast the class fills up:
- Group by semester & Class & Section, aggregate on how many days does it take to fill the enrollment cap
- Why do we need this? To Prioritize which courses to add seats to first
